### Adding More Games
Edit `lib/data.ts` and add to the `gamesData` array:

```typescript
{
  title: "Your Game",
  description: "Game description",
  tags: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"],
  imageUrl: YourGameImg,
  imagePath: "https://your-game-url.com",
  category: "Arcade" // or "Classic", "Utility", etc.
}
```

### Customizing Animations
Use the animation components in `components/scroll-animations.tsx`:

```tsx
import { FadeInUp, StaggerContainer, StaggerItem } from './scroll-animations';

<FadeInUp delay={0.2}>
  <YourComponent />
</FadeInUp>
```

## Performance Notes
- All animations use `framer-motion` with optimized settings
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Scroll animations use `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-triggering
- Mobile menu uses `AnimatePresence` for smooth transitions
